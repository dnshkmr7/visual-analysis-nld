# Visual analysis of logistic maps

Used MATLAB R2022a-academic use to study and visualise:
* low dimensional chaos
* period doubling

in non-linear systems specifically logistic map.

Report explaining the logistic map can be found [here](https://github.com/dnshkmr7/visual-analysis-nld/blob/main/EP3227_Project_Report.pdf).

# Usage

## GrowthRate.m

User can't vary the initial population in this program, look at Population.m for the before mentioned task. User has the choice to construct a single plot or multiple plot. Enter appropriate choice and proceed to enter proper growth-rate parameters to get the desired plot.

<div align=center> <img src="Plots/Plot1-1.png" width="400" title="1：single plot"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Plots/Plot1-2.png" width="400" title="1：multiple plot"/></div>

## Population.m

User can't have multiple plots of growth-rate parameters in this program, look at GrowthRate.m for the before mentioned task. User has the choice to construct a single plot or multiple plot. Enter appropriate choice and proceed to enter proper initial population parameters to get the desired plot.

<div align=center> <img src="Plots/Plot2-1.png" width="400" title="2：single plot"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Plots/Plot2-2.png" width="400" title="2：multiple plot"/></div>

## Bifurcation.m

This constructs the bifurcation diagram of logistic map, there are no input prompts in this program. User needs to manually change the constants used in the code and run it to get desired plot.
